Note that FV3 lat-lon grids are located at the center of each grid box, 
start from south to north, and from east to west.
For example, for a 0.5-deg uniform grid,
nlon=720, nlat=360
X(1,1)=[0.25E,89.75S]
X(nlon,nlat)=[359.75E,89.75N]

write out nemsio, S->N is reversed to N->S to follow NCEP convention

updated to handle both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic cases. They have different output numbers and variable names.

In FV3 tic26 branch which includes the lastest Write Component, hgtsfc has been defined as [m] instead of [gpm].  
The scaling by 1/grav in fv3nc2nemsio.fd needs to be removed.
